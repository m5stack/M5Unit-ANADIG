# M5Unit - ANADIG

## Overview

Library for ANADIG using [M5UnitUnified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5UnitUnified).  
M5UnitUnified is a library for unified handling of various M5 units products.

### SKU:U012
DAC, is a unit with the ability to convert digital signal to analog signal (voltage waveform signal) with support for audio waveform and more. It integrates a 12-bit high resolution DAC chip named MCP4725 which has an on-board non-volatile memory (EEPROM). The unit communicates with the M5Core using the I2C protocol.

### SKU:U012-B
DAC2 Unit is an I2C digital-to-analog signal conversion unit. It utilizes the GP8413 solution, which provides high precision and accuracy in its performance. This chip can linearly convert a 15-bit digital value into two independent analog voltages of 0-5V or 0-10V. The output voltage error is only 0.2%, and it achieves linearity of up to 0.01%.

### SKU:U013-V11
ADC V1.1 Unit is an A/D conversion module that utilizes the ADS1110 chip, a 16-bit self-calibrating analog-to-digital converter. It is designed with an I2C interface, offering convenient connectivity. The module offers conversion speeds of 8, 16, 32, and 128 samples per second (SPS), providing varying levels of accuracy at 16, 15, 14, and 12 bits of resolution respectively.

### SKU:U068-B
DAC2 Hat is an I2C digital-to-analog signal conversion unit designed to be compatible with the StickC series controllers. It offers high precision and accuracy in its performance by using the GP8413 solution

### SKU:U069
ADC HAT is another type of C-HAT specifically design for M5StickC controller. Same as ADC unit, this is an ADC converter component for stickc. Packed with an ADC converter chip ADS1100, 

### SKU:U069-V11
ADC HAT V1.1 is another type of C-HAT specifically design for M5StickC controller. Same as ADC unit, this is an ADC converter component for stickc. Packed with an ADC converter chip ADS1110,
